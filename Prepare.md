# Prepare
## Key Tasks 

### 1. Download data and store it appropriately:
- Downloaded one year’s worth of Cyclistic’s historical trip data (e.g., divvy_tripdata for Jan–Dec 2024).
- Stored all individual months' data in a single local folder titled ‘Cyclistic_trip_data_2024’

### 2. Identify how the data is organized:
- Examined the data structure by opening the files.
- Documented the key fields, data types, and their description

### 3. Determine the credibility of the data:
- Provided by Motivate International Inc.
- Reliable and ethical to use under the Divvy public data license
- Highlighted limitations such as privacy restrictions and potential missing values

## Folder Structure: 
/Cyclistic_trip_data_2024/raw data

202401-divvy-tripdata.csv

202402-divvy-tripdata.csv

and so on...


*This prepare phase ensures that the dataset is ready for further analysis.*
